# Finoa - Frontend Engineer - Offline Coding Exercise

Using TypeScript and a frontend development framework of your choice,
for example Angular, Vue, or React, please build a simple todo
application that can be accessed and used in the browser. We do not
expect a super fancy, feature-loaded application, but would like to
get to know your way of structuring a project and implementing the
necessary code. Every detail not specified in the requirements below
is up to you. Please **do not** spend more than **two hours** on this
task and feel free to also hand in your work in progress if you did
not finish the complete task on time.

## Specific requirements:

The todo application shall consist out of a single view and be
implemented as a single page application, background requests are
preferred over page reloads. Within the view, there should be a list
of all currently existing todo tasks and an easy interface to add a
new todo task, i.e., two input fields to add a name as well as
description for a new task and a button to save the new task. Besides
adding a new task, one should be able to tick existing tasks, such
that the application marks these tasks as done. Please make your todo
application persistent across page reloads by adding a basic API
endpoint which can store a new task and return all
available tasks. Finally, please add at least one unit test and one
integration test which can be run automatically, indicating how you
would test your work.

## Additional requirements:

If you have the time and the ideas, feel free to add comments to
your code explaining your design decisions with respect to the
application's structure, concept and design. For example, why
something is built as a reusable component, how one could extend the
application with further features, what are advantages and
disadvantages of your decisions, etc.. If you want, you can add stubs
for features one could add but you did not implement, e.g. a menu bar
containing a profile image or something like this.

## What will be evaluated:

1. clean and understandable code,
2. overall structure and concept of the application,
3. maintainability and test-ability of the code,
4. extend-ability of the application with further features and
5. overall familiarity with the coding language and ecosystem.

## How to submit:

Please send a link to a git repository containing your code or a
zip-archive containing your repository, including the `.git`
directory.
