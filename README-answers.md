# Things I could do better

- Implement better validation on frontend (Although I validated in the backend)
- Make the page responsive
- Wrote more test
- Taken more time in the assessment
- I am still trying to integrate typescript, I didnt because I felt it will slow me down, given my proficiency, I've started learning though. Hopefully that won't be a problem.

## Some design decisons

- I decided to use react context api, its a bit faster
- I decided to have both the form and the List on the same page, I think it looks better
